SmartSDLC – AI-Enhanced Software Development Lifecycle is an innovative project that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the traditional Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to make the entire development process smarter, faster, and more efficient. This approach leverages AI technologies like IBM Watsonx AI, Granite LLM, FastAPI, and Streamlit to assist developers, testers, project managers, and other stakeholders in building software systems with improved automation, prediction, and optimization.

🔍 What is SDLC?

SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) is a step-by-step process for developing high-quality software. The main phases include:

1. Requirement Gathering


2. Planning


3. Design


4. Development


5. Testing


6. Deployment


7. Maintenance

🚀 What Makes It “Smart”?

SmartSDLC enhances each SDLC phase by embedding AI-driven intelligence into it:

Phase	AI Enhancement	Example Use Case

1. Requirement Analysis	AI-powered NLP models (e.g., Watsonx) to convert user stories or speech into clear software requirements	Auto-generate requirement documents
2. Planning	AI helps estimate time, cost, and resource needs using historical data	Smart project estimation
3. Design	AI-generated UML diagrams or wireframes	Convert text requirements into system design
4. Development	AI code assistants (Granite or Watsonx Code LLMs) suggest and generate boilerplate or complex code	FastAPI backend generation
5. Testing	AI-based test case generation, bug prediction, and test automation	Predict defects early
6. Deployment	AI-optimized CI/CD pipelines	Suggest optimal deployment strategies
7. Maintenance	AI bots monitor logs and user feedback to detect performance issues or bugs	Proactive support
